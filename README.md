# Project Proposal  
Departing from traditional supervised learning, our project leverages reinforcement learning, enabling the model to interact with the stock market environment and learn optimal strategies for maximising cumulative rewards. 



### MDP for Stock Price Prediction:

Agent – An Agent A that works in Environment E  
Action – Buy/Sell/Hold  
States – Data values  
Rewards – Profit / Loss  
 
### The Role of Q – Learning

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the quality of actions telling an agent what action to take under what circumstances. 
Q-learning finds an optimal policy in the sense of maximizing the expected value of the total reward over any successive steps, starting from the current state.
